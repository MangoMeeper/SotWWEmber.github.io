<div class="modal" id="Attacking">
	<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
	<div class="modal-dialog">
		<h2>Attacking</h2>
		<p>
			You attack when you use a weapon, natural weapon, improvised
weapon, or an unarmed attack to harm a creature or object. Details
on unarmed attacks appear in their own section.
		</p>

		<h2>Resolving Attacks</h2>
		<p>
			You resolve any attack you make by following these steps: <br>
<a>Step 1:Choose a Target: </a> Pick a target within reach for
a melee attack or within the range of your weapon for a
ranged attack. If you attack a target completely behind a
covering object, you target the object instead (see Cover). <br>
<a>Step 2: Attribute Roll: </a>Make an attribute roll against
the target’s Defense. You use Strength for melee weapons
and Agility for ranged weapons.<br>
<a>Step 3: Apply Result:</a> If the result of your roll is a success,
you roll the weapon’s damage dice. The target adds the sum
of the roll to its damage total. If the result of your roll was a
failure, you miss or fail to land an appreciable blow.
		</p>

		
		<p><a>WEAPONS:</a>
			A weapon is an object constructed for the purpose of harming
others and includes swords, axes, and the like. A weapon is either
melee, for use in hand-to-hand combat, or ranged. Many weapons have traits that affect how you use them. Weapon traits are
described in Chapter 3.
		</p>

		
		<p> <a>NATURAL WEAPONS:</a>
			A natural weapon is part of a creature’s body that can harm others. It counts as having the Nimble trait (see Chapter 3). Examples
include horns, spiked tails, claws, and fangs. A creature with a nat-
ural weapon is always wielding a melee weapon and cannot be dis-
armed. When attacking with two weapons, natural weapons count
as off-hand weapons. For information on unarmed attacks that do
not count as natural weapons, see page 50
		</p>

		<p> <a>UNARMED STRIKE:</a>
			You punch, kick, elbow, or headbutt. Making an unarmed attack
counts as using an improvised weapon. However, if the target is
larger than you, it takes 1 damage if you get a success rather than
1d6 damage.
		</p>

		
		<p><a>IMPROVISED WEAPONS</a>
			An improvised weapon is an object constructed for a function
other than harm but nevertheless can cause injury. Examples
include frying pans and broken bottles. When you use an impro-
vised weapon to attack, you roll with 1 bane. On a critical success
or critical failure, the improvised weapon breaks. An improvised
weapon deals 1d6 damage. Reduce any Bonus Damage applied to
the attack to 0.
		</p>

		<p><a>ATTACKING WITH TWO WEAPONS</a> If you wield two weapons—one in each hand, you can attack with
			either.<br>
			Alternatively, if one weapon can be wielded in an off-hand grip,
			you can attack with both weapons at the same time. You resolve
			the attack using the weapon you wield in your main hand. If the
			roll results in a success, add the off-hand weapon’s damage as extra
			damage for the attack. Then, apply Bonus Damage, if any.<br>
			For example, say your rogue wields a sword in one hand and a
			dagger in the other. You attack. If you get a success, your attack
			deals 3d6 damage: 2d6 from the sword and 1d6 from the dagger,
			plus any Bonus Damage you have available.</p>

		
		<p> <a>MUTIPLE ATTACKS:</a>
			When you attack, you can decide to make multiple attacks. To do
			so, reduce the amount of Bonus Damage by 2 dice for each addi-
			tional attack you wish to make. If you lack the required number of
			Bonus Damage, you make no additional attacks.<br>
			For each additional attack beyond the first, you choose a differ-
			ent target. Of the remaining Bonus Damage, you can divide them
			between the attacks, making the decision about how much Bonus
			Damage to use after you determine if the attack is a success or a
			failure.<br>
			For example, a player has +3d6 Bonus Damage and uses an
			action to attack. The player decides to make two attacks, and thus
			expends 2d6 Bonus Damage. The player makes the first attack. If it
			results in a success, the player can apply the remaining 1d6 Bonus
			Damage to that attack or hold it in reserve for the second attack. <br>
			You can substitute an unarmed attack for each additional attack
you make. <br>
If you wield two weapons, you can make additional attacks using
either weapon.

<div class="modal" id="Attack Options">
	<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
	<div class="modal-dialog">
		<h2>Attack Options</h2>
		<p>
			In combat, sometimes you need to do more than just hit the
opponent. You might want to shove an enemy back, or distract
an enemy enough to let one of your allies escape danger. Attack
options enable you to do more. <br>
You can use an attack option when you use an action to attack
if you meet the requirements (if any), but before you roll the dice.
When you successfully use an attack option, the weapon’s damage does not contribute to the damage dealt by the attack—only
Bonus Damage.<br>
For example, a player makes a disrupting attack with a sword.
The player has +1d6 Bonus Damage. The player gets a success, so
the attack deals 1d6 damage from the Bonus Damage alone, in
addition to possibly disrupting the target.
		</p>

		
					<p><a>DISRUPTING ATTACK:</a> If you get a success on the roll to attack and your roll equals or
						exceeds the target’s Will + 5, the target grants 1 boon on the next
						roll to attack it before the start of your next turn.</p>

						<p><a>DRIVING ATTACK:</a> If you wield a one-handed or two-handed melee weapon or you
							have a shield equipped, and you get a success on the roll to attack
							a target of your Size + 1 or smaller and the result equals or exceeds
							the target’s Strength + 5, you can push the target up to 5 yards
							away from you.</p>

							<p><a>FEINTING ATTACK:</a> If you wield a one-handed or off-handed weapon, and you get a
								success on the roll to attack and the result of your roll equals or exceeds the target’s Intellect + 5, you gain the Slippery trait until
								the end of your turn.</p>

								<p><a>GUARDED ATTACK:</a> If you have a shield equipped and you get a success on the roll to
									attack, you impose 1 bane on the next roll to attack you before
									the start of your next turn. This benefit ends early if you become
									confused, held, stunned, or unconscious.</p>

									<p><a>LUNGING ATTACK:</a> If you wield a one-handed or two-handed melee weapon, you can
										choose a target for your attack as if your reach was 1 yard greater.</p>

					<p><a>PRESSING ATTACK:</a> If you get a success on the roll to attack and the result equals or
						exceeds the target’s Agility + 5, you impose 1 bane on the next roll
						the target makes to attack before the start of your next turn.</p>

	<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
	<div class="modal-dialog">
		<h2>Combat Circumstances</h2>
		<p>
			Certain circumstances can make attacking harder or easier. The
following situations represent those commonly encountered in a
fight.
		</p>
	
		<p><a>SURROUNDED TARGET:</a>
		
			When you make a melee attack against a target in the reach of at
least one ally, you roll with 1 boon. Creatures whose Size is more
than 2 larger than yours ignore this effect.
		</p>
		<p><a>WITHIN REACH OF AN ENEMY:</a>
		
			If you make a ranged attack while in the reach of at least one
enemy, you roll with 1 bane.
		</p>
		<p><a>CALLED SHOT:</a> When you attack, you aim for a specific place on the target’s body.
			Doing so imposes 2 banes on your roll. On a success, the target
			becomes impaired in an attribute of your choice until the end of
			the next turn. If you aim for an object the target wears or carries
			and you get a success, the object takes the damage instead.</p>

			<p><a>LONG-RANGE SHOOTING:</a> When you make a ranged attack, you can target a creature beyond
				your weapon’s range, but no more than twice its range. You roll to
				attack with 1 bane.</p>

		<p><a>COVER:</a>
		
			A target that is behind an obstacle of its Size or larger (which can
be a creature or an object) has partial cover from enemies that can
see any part of its body, but not all of it. Partial cover imposes 1
bane on rolls against the covered target’s Defense and Agility, and
grants the target 1 boon on Agility rolls made to resist harmful
effects originating from beyond the cover.<br>
A target has total cover from enemies if they have no line of
sight to it because the target is completely behind an obstacle.
Such a target cannot be directly attacked or targeted by an effect
unless the rules say otherwise. Instead, attacks against the target
strike the obstacle. If the obstacle is destroyed as a result, any addi-
tional damage dealt by that attack or effect is applied to whatever
was behind the obstacle.<br>
These rules apply only in situations when an attacker cannot
position itself to get a clear shot against a target.
		</p>
		<p><a>HIGH GROUND:</a>
		
			When you occupy a space higher than that occupied by the target
of your attack, you roll with 1 boon.
		</p>
		
		<p><a>OBSCUREMENT:</a>
		
			You roll to attack with 1 bane while you or the target are in an area
affected by obscurement of any kind.
		</p>
		<p><a>INVISIBLE:</a>
		
			If you can’t see the target but have a general idea of its location, you
roll with 3 banes.
		</p>
		<p><a>SUBMERGED:</a>
		
			When you attack with a weapon other than a natural weapon
and you are submerged in a liquid, you roll with 1 bane. The Sage
might disallow attack with certain weapons, such as bows, slings,
and weapons with the Slow trait.
		</p>

	<div class="modal-dialog">
		<h2>Disarm</h2>
		<p>
			When you attack, you can choose to disarm the target rather than
deal damage to it. The target must be a creature of your Size or
smaller. You roll with 1 bane if you use a melee weapon, 2 banes
if you use an improvised weapon, or 3 banes if you use a ranged
weapon. On a success, the target takes no damage. Instead, the tar-
get makes an Agility roll. For every 2d6 Bonus Damage you have,
impose 1 bane on the target’s roll. On a failure, the target drops
one object it holds in its hands. If you can reach the target, you can
use a reaction to catch the object (see Reactions).

		<h2>Shove</h2>
		<p>
			You attempt to shove a creature away from you. Choose one crea-
ture in your reach whose Size is no more than 2 higher than yours.
Make a Strength roll against the target’s Strength. You roll with 1
boon if you have a shield equipped and 1 boon if you move at least
5 yards before you make the attempt. On a success, you push the
target a number of yards away from you equal to your Strength
modifier (minimum 1). If the target is larger than you, it moves
half the distance (minimum 0) instead. On a critical success, the
target falls prone at the end of the movement.

		<h2>Trip</h2>
		<p>
			You attempt to knock a creature to the ground. Choose one creature in your reach whose Size is no more than 2 higher than yours.
Make an Agility roll against the target’s choice of Strength or
Agility. If you have a shield equipped, you roll with 1 boon. On
a success, the target falls prone. On a critical success, the target’s

<div class="modal" id="Grab">
	<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
	<div class="modal-dialog">
		<h2>Grab</h2>
		<p>
			You try to grab a creature. Choose one creature in your reach
whose Size is no more than 1 higher than yours. Make a Strength
or Agility roll against the target’s Agility. You succeed automati-
cally against a held creature. On a success, the target becomes held
by you until the end of your next turn. The affliction ends early if
you release the target, which you can do freely. The effect also ends
if you move away from the target without dragging it (see Drag) or
you become confused, controlled, stunned, or unconscious. <br>
If you have a target grabbed, you can use an action to extend the
duration of the grab until the end of your next turn.
		</p>

		<p><a>DRAG:</a>You attempt to pull a creature you have grabbed. Make a Strength
			roll against the Strength of a creature held by your successful grab.
			On a success, you move as normal and the creature moves with
			you, and you maintain the grab. On a failure, you can move, but if
			you do so the grab ends. </p>

			<p><a>WRESTLE:</a>You attempt to wrestle down a creature you have grabbed. Make
				a Strength or Agility roll against the target’s choice of Strength or
				Agility. On a success, you can choose one of the following effects:<br>
				• The target falls prone and the grab ends.<br>
				• You and the target fall prone and you maintain the grab.<br>
				• The target takes 1d6 damage and you maintain the grab.<br>
				• If you and the target are both prone, you pin the target and
				maintain the grab. A pinned creature is confused, held,
				weakened, and cannot stand up until the effect ends. The
				target remains pinned until you release it, which you can do
				at any time, or if you stand up or use an action to do any-
				thing other than wrestle the target. Also, you release a target
				automatically if you become confused, impaired, stunned,
				or weakened.</p>

				<p><a>ESCAPE:</a>If you are held by being grabbed or pinned, you can attempt to
					escape by making a Strength or Agility roll against the Strength
					or Agility (your choice) of the creature that has you held. On a
					success, you end the held affliction. If you get a critical success, you
					can also use a reaction to attempt to grab the creature that grabbed
					you, provided that creature is an eligible target. </p>

<div class="modal" id="Casting Spells">
	<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
	<div class="modal-dialog">
		<h2>Casting Spells</h2>
		<p>
			You cast a spell that you have learned from a tradition, is contained
in an object you are wielding, or you have as an inscription. <br>
Normally, you can cast any spell you have learned once, provided you can speak aloud its mystical words at a volume equivalent to normal conversation or louder. Some spells enable you to
cast them more often. Once you cast a spell, you regain the ability
to cast it only after you rest.
		</p>

		<p><a>TARGETING:</a> Unless the spell says otherwise, you must be able to see a target
			and draw a line of effect between yourself and it. Spell effects don’t
			move around corners and other obstacles unless their rules say
			otherwise. An invisible wall or some other unseen obstacle might
			block the path and reveal itself only after you cast the spell.</p>

			<p><a>DURATION:</a> Unless the spell says otherwise, it ends as soon as you resolve the
				effect. Many spells last for a specific period of time. In such cases,
				the spell effect persists for the indicated time or until you use an
				action to end the effect.</p>
			
				<p><a>ROLLS:</a> Some spells require you to make an attribute roll to produce the
					desired effect or to improve its effect, while other spells might
					allow targets to mitigate the spell’s effects with a successful roll.
					If a spell has multiple targets and calls for a roll, you roll for each
					target separately.</p>

					<p><a>RITUALS:</a> Some talents and spells require you to perform a ritual to produce
						their effects. Performing a ritual takes 10 minutes, during which
						time you cannot move from your space. When you finish, the
						effect happens. Many rituals also require the expenditure of other
						resources, which are expended when you finish the ritual. If some-
						thing interrupts the ritual before you can finish, you expend no
						resources, but you must start over from the beginning to produce
						its effects.</p>

			You can use a reaction once each round to perform one of the
following special activities. Each activity describes the event that

			During your turn in combat, you can move a number of yards
equal to your Speed score using your primary mode of locomo-

You can also spend yards of movement to move in special ways.
If your Speed is 5, you could walk 1 yard over to a wall and then

spent. Similarly, if you are swimming, you could spend 4 yards of

			Magical effects can teleport you, transporting you with whatever
you are wearing and carrying from one place to another in an

If an effect teleports multiple targets, all of them appear in the
same positions they had relative to each other before they moved.
Finally, movement by teleportation does not trigger free attacks. <br>
Some teleportation effects enable you to teleport to empty
spaces. Any space you deem to be empty is a legitimate target for
the spell. However, if there is an invisible creature or object in that
space, you make an Intellect roll. On a failure, both you and the
creature or object occupying the space lose 1d6 Health and the
smaller of the two (if the same Size, the Sage chooses) is pushed
into the nearest empty space away from the direction you traveled.

		<h2>Attribute Modifier</h2>
		<p>
			The rules or the Sage will tell you
which attribute (and thus which modifier) to use for a roll. The
attribute modifier is added to your roll to determine the result.
		</p>
		
		
		<p><a>TARGET NUMBER:</a>
			The reason for making the attribute roll
determines the target number. Normally, the target number is 10
if no one resists the effort that warranted making the roll. If you
make a roll that is opposed by a creature or object, the target number
is the score of the attribute you are rolling against.<br>
If an activity is resisted by multiple targets, such as when you
affect more than one enemy at a time, you make one attribute roll
per target.
		</p>
		
		<p><a>DETERMINE OUTCOME:</a>
		
			You determine the outcome by
following these steps: Roll a d20, add the modifier for the appropriate
attribute, and then compare the result to the target number.
You get a success if the result equals or exceeds the target number
or a failure if it doesn’t.

		<h2>Boons and Banes</h2>
		<p>
			A boon is an advantageous circumstance that improves your
chance of success. For each boon that applies, you roll a boon die,
which is a d6. You then add the highest number rolled on any one
of the boons to your attribute roll. <br>
A bane is a disadvantage that reduces your chance of success.
For each bane that applies, you roll a bane die, which is a d6. You
then subtract the highest number rolled on any one of the banes
from your attribute roll.<br>
Boons and banes cancel each other out on a one-for-one basis
before any boon or bane dice are rolled. If you have 2 boons and 1
bane for the activity you attempt, you roll with 1 boon. If you have
1 boon and 3 banes, you roll with 2 banes.

		<h2>Critical Success</h2>
		<p>
			Some game effects take effect when you get a critical success. A
critical success occurs when the result of your roll is 20 or higher
and exceeds the target number by at least 5. Normally, a critical
success produces no additional effect without a trait or talent, but
the Sage can offer an improved outcome with such a result.
		</p>
		<h2>Critical Failure</h2>
		<p>
			Some game effects take effect when you get a critical
failure. A critical failure occurs when the result
of your roll is 0 or less. Many talents and spells
cause targets to suffer additional effects when
they get critical failures. The Sage might also
impose negative consequences when you get a
critical failure.

		<h2>Luck Rolls</h2>
		<p>
			Sometimes, the rules or the Sage might call for a luck roll to see
what happens. A luck roll uses no attribute, so it’s just a roll of a
d20. Since you never make a luck roll against a creature or object,
the target is always 10.
		</p>
<p><a>(LUCK ENDS):</a> If you are subject to an effect that has the (luck
ends) notation, you make a luck roll at the end of the round. If you
have multiple (luck ends) effects affecting you, you make a separate luck roll for each effect, in any order you choose. If you have
a (luck ends both) or (luck ends all) effect, you make a single roll.
On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the effect persists until

to end the effect. <br>
You can end a (luck ends) effect with a successful use of the
Overcome action (see page 46).</p>

		<h2>Death</h2>
		<p>
			You die when your Health score drops to 0. Provided the cause of
death does not destroy your body, your remains become an object
with a normal Health score equal to its Size × 20. Remains of
organic material decay, lose 1d6 Health (or more in warm, moist
conditions) each day until they completely rot away. If an effect
restores you to life, any loss of Health by your corpse is a permanent reduction to your normal Health score, reflecting the ravages
of decay, lost body parts, and so on.

		<h2>Rest</h2>
		<p>
			Characters have many ways to heal damage and regain Health.
They might avail themselves of poultices, elixirs, spells, talents,
and other game effects. But the most reliable way to recover from
injuries is resting. <br>
Resting allows you to heal damage and regain expended
resources. If you have uninterrupted rest for 6 consecutive hours,
you heal all damage and regain Health equal to one-tenth your
normal Health score. Some of your other resources, such as spells
or talents, might also be replenished after a rest. If you stop resting
to use an action or reaction, the time you spent resting up to that
point is wasted and you must start resting again to gain any benefit
from doing so.

			<a>Learn a Language</a> <br> A character learns any non-
			secret language, or a secret one if the character
			has access to someone who knows it and is willing
			to teach it.
			<a>Professional Training</a><br>
			Characters train to
			learn an additional profession. The
			character must choose one specific profession and
			own the items normally granted by the profession,
			if there are any. If a character would become a
			politician, for example, they must purchase or
			otherwise acquire a set of superior clothing.<br>

			<a>Discover a Tradition</a><br>
			Characters can attempt
to discover new magical traditions, provided they
have access to someone who has discovered the
tradition already or to a place where information
about the tradition might be found, such as a
temple, library, or magical academy. It takes two
downtime periods to complete this training. When
complete, the character discovers the tradition
and can choose spells from it when they would
learn spells. <br>
			<a>Activity Training</a><br>
			Characters can spend time
training to perform activities related to one of
their attributes. During the next quest, when the
character gets a failure on a roll using the trained
attribute, they can discard the result and roll
again. A character can use this training benefit
once as a novice, twice as an expert, and three
times as a master. Once the last use has been
expended, the benefit is lost.
			<a>Retraining</a><br>
			If a character gained a talent from a
selection of choices, such as the Fighting Style talents in the fighter path or talents gained from
discovering a tradition, they can swap out the
talent for a different one. Similarly, a character can
swap knowledge of one spell for a different spell of
the same tier from a tradition the character has
discovered.

		<h2>Attributes</h2>
		<p>All characters, most creatures, and some objects use a set of four
			attributes to describe their basic capabilities: Strength, Agility,
			Intellect, and Will. Each attribute has a score, a number from 1 to
			20, that measures how adept the creature or object is at perform-
			ing activities related to its use. A typical person has a score of 10 in
			each attribute. A higher score indicates exceptional ability, while a
			lower score describes a diminished capacity. <br>
			The score also determines the attribute modifier, which is
			always equal to the score minus 10. If you have a Strength score of
			12, you have a +2 Strength modifier. If you have an Agility score
			of 9, you have a –1 Agility modifier.</p>
		<p><a>STRENGTH:</a>
			Strength represents muscle power, durability, athletic ability, and
overall fitness. You use Strength to resist effects that force you to
move or that restrain you, as well as when you climb, swim, attack
with most hand-to-hand weapons, kick down a door, or overpower
another creature. Strength also helps you withstand or fight
off the effects of pain, injury, poison, or infection. <br>
		
		• Climb and swim<br>
		• Run<br>
		• Break something<br>
		• Withstand poison or infection<br>
		• Make a melee attack<br>
		• Make an unarmed attack<br>
	</p>
		
		
		<p> <a>AGILITY:</a>
			Agility encompasses poise, dexterity, balance, and reflexes. You
use Agility when you want to keep your footing, perhaps because
someone has just shoved you or you are moving across challenging
terrain. Agility also comes into play when you attempt a task that
requires manual dexterity, such as picking a lock, disarming a trap,
or performing a feat of legerdemain.<br>
• Balance<br>
• Leap<br>
• Dodge<br>
• Make a ranged attack and some melee attacks<br>
• Make some unarmed attacks<br>
• Pick a lock<br>
		</p>
		

		<p> <a>INTELLECT:</a>
			Intellect measures intelligence, wit, memory, and knowledge. You
rely on Intellect to thwart an effort to deceive you, decipher a
coded message, or outwit another creature. Intellect also governs
your ability to use some forms of magic.<br>
• Recall pertinent information<br>
• Solve a puzzle<br>
• Pass a lie off as the truth<br>
• Cast a spell<br>
• Spot an illusion<br>
• Find a clue<br>
		</p>
		
		<p> <a>WILL:</a>
			Will describes courage, willpower, resolve, and mental fortitude.
You use Will to resist efforts to erode your confidence, manipulate
your emotions, or terrify you. As with Intellect, Will is also needed
to use some forms of magic.<br>
• Intimidate others<br>
• Persuade someone<br>
• Fight off fear<br>
• Resist mind control<br>
• Cast a spell<br>
• Maintain one’s focus while beset with
distractions<br>

		<h2> Defense</h2>
		<p>
			Defense represents how reflexes, combat training, instinct, and
protective equipment contribute to a creature or object’s ability to
escape harm from attacks. All creatures and objects have a Defense
score, which is the target number for attackers’ attribute rolls.
Defense scores range from 0 to 25. A creature or object with no
way to protect itself from an attack has a Defense score of 0. <br>

<a>NATURAL DEFENSE:</a> All creatures and objects capable of
defending themselves have a natural Defense score. Your novice
path determines your natural Defense. Wearing armor, as well as
some magical effects, can increase or replace your natural Defense.
See Chapter 3 for more information on armor.

		<h2>Health</h2>
		<p>
			All creatures and objects have Health scores, which represents the
maximum amount of damage they take before becoming incapacitated or destroyed. Since other effects can increase or decrease
one’s Health score, keep track of your normal Health score separately from your current Health score. <br>
When the rules refer to Health, they refer to the creature or
object’s current Health unless they say otherwise. <br>
Changing your Health score can affect your damage total. If
your Health score drops below your damage total, you reduce your
damage total so it equals your current Health score, which causes
you to become incapacitated. If you are incapacitated, and your
Health score increases, your damage total also increases to match
the new score, so you remain incapacitated until you heal damage.

		<h2>Damage</h2>
		<p>
			Damage describes injury from a harmful effect. You keep a run-
ning total of damage accumulated. Your damage total can be as
low as 0 or as high as your Health score. (Damage in excess of your
Health score is ignored. Also, see page 8 for details on halving
damage.) When you take damage, you add the amount to your
damage total. When you heal damage, subtract the amount from
your damage total.

		<h2>Injured</h2>
		<p>
			You are injured if your damage total equals or exceeds half your
Health score. Typically, you suffer no effects from being injured,
but certain talents, spells, and other effects used against you might
put you at a disadvantage because you’re injured.

		<h2>Incapacitated</h2>
		<p>When your damage total equals your Health score, you fall prone
			and become incapacitated. Any damage taken in excess of that
			causing you to become incapacitated is lost. You are unconscious
			for as long as you are incapacitated. <br>
			<a>TAKING DAMAGE WHILE INCAPACITATED:</a> If you take
			damage while incapacitated, you instead lose Health equal to the
			amount of damage you would take.<br>
			<a>ENDING INCAPACITATED:</a> You stop being incapacitated
			when your damage total is less than your Health score. Thus any
			amount of healing can end being incapacitated.<br>
			If you are incapacitated at the end of the round in combat or
			in a situation using rounds, you lose 1d6 Health and make a luck
			roll. On a success, you heal 1 damage. On a failure, you remain
			incapacitated. <br>
			If you become incapacitated when not using rounds, the Sage
			tracks time with rounds until you are no longer incapacitated. </p>

		<h2>Bonus Damage</h2>
		<p>
			From the paths you choose, you might have a supply of Bonus
Damage, which is expressed as +1d6 or more. Once per round,
when you get a success on a roll to attack with a weapon or natural weapon (though not improvised weapons or unarmed attacks), you
can roll some or all of your Bonus Damage along with the weapon’s
damage. The Bonus Damage rolled counts as extra damage. <br>
For example, a level 3 fighter has +2d6 Bonus Damage. The
fighter succeeds on a roll to attack with a sword, which normally
deals 2d6 damage, but, because of the Bonus Damage, the fighter
can deal up to 4d6 damage instead.

		<h2>Traditions</h2>
		<p>
			Some paths let you discover one or more traditions—thematic
groupings of talents and spells. When the path indicates you discover
a tradition, you can choose one new tradition or make a discovery
from a tradition you have discovered already. </p>

<p> <a>TRADITION TALENT:</a>


Discovering a tradition grants you one talent from it. In addition,
each time you discover a tradition you have discovered, you gain
another talent from the tradition. If you have four talents from a
tradition already, you instead learn a novice spell from the tradition.</p>

<p><a>SPELLS:</a>

Each tradition offers three tiers of spells: novice, expert, and master.
If your path instructs you to learn a spell of a particular tier,
choose the spell of the indicated tier or lower from any tradition
you have discovered. <br>
Alternatively, you can choose a spell you have already learned
when you would learn a spell. When you do so, you increase the
castings for this spell by the number of castings the spell normally
grants. If the spell has 3 castings and you learn it again, you have 6
castings for this spell. </p>

		<h2>Talents</h2>
		<p>
			All paths grant at least one talent at level 1 and usually additional
talents at higher levels. Talents represent learned abilities. A talent
can modify certain activities you perform, such as attacking or
casting a spell, or they could let you use actions, reactions, and the
like in different ways. Certain talents produce magical effects, and
this is indicated with (Magical) in their entries.
